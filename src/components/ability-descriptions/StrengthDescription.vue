        <h2>Strength</h2>
        <p>Strength measures muscle and physical power. 
            This ability is important for those who engage in hand-to-hand combat, such as fighters, barbarians, and paladins. 
            Strength also sets the maximum amount of weight your character can carry.</p>
        <p>You apply your character's Strength modifier to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Melee attack rolls</li>
            <li>Damage rolls when using a melee or thrown weapon</li>
            <li>Climb, Swim, and Strength checks</li>
            <li>Strength checks (for breaking down doors and the like)</li>
        </ul>
