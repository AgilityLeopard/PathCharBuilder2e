        <h2>Constitution</h2>
        <p>Constitution represents your character's health and stamina. A Constitution bonus increases a character's hit points, so the ability is important for all characters.</p>
        <p>You apply your character's Constitution  modifier to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The number of hitpoints gained at each level</li>
            <li>Fortitude saving throws (for resisting poison, disease, and similar threats)</li>
        </ul>
