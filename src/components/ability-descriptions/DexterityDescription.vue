        <h2>Dexterity</h2>
        <p>
            Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance. 
            This ability is the most important one for rogues and rangers, but it's also useful for characters who wear light or medium armor or no armor at all such as wizards and sorcerers. 
            This ability is vital for characters seeking to excel with ranged weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
            You apply your character's Dexterity modifier to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ranged attack rolls</li>
            <li>Armor class (Ability to avoid attacks)</li>
            <li>Reflex saving throws (for quickly avoiding hazards)</li>
            <li>Acrobatics, Disable Device, Escape Artist, Fly, Ride, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks</li>
        </ul>
