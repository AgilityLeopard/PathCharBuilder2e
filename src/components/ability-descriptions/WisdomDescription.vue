        <h2>Wisdom</h2>
        <p>
            Wisdom describes a character's willpower, common sense, awareness, and intuition. 
            Wisdom is the most important ability for divine spellcasters like Clerics and Druids. But any character that wants to have acute senses, should have a high score in Wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
            You apply your character's Wisdom modifier to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Will saving throws (for negating the effects of compulsions, charms, and other spells)</li>
            <li>The difficulty to resist your divine spells<li>
            <li>Heal, Perception, Profession, Sense Motive, and Survival checks</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
